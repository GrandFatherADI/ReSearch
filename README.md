# Re Search

**Re Search** is a Logic2 extension that adds searches for text matching a given
regular expression in textual output from low level analyzers and outputs the
matched text.

This is a useful tool for finding data of interest generated by various LLAs and
quickly navigating between matches using Logic's skip facilities.

At present the Async Serial LLA is supported and the I<sup>2</sup>C LLA is mostly
supported.

## Instructions

Install **ReSearch** by clicking "Install" on the **Re Search** entry in the
Extensions panel.

Use the Analyzers side panel to use a Re Search analyzer with a suitable low
level analyser. At present the Async Serial analyzer is well supported. I2C
partial support has been added, but not thoroughly tested. Untested support for
other LLAs may be added in the future.

In the ReSearch Settings dialog select the required input analyzer then set the
regular expression match string. Python regular expression syntax is used for
the match string. Note that the provided match is not checked for syntax errors
(a badly formed string will generate a somewhat cryptic error dialog in Logic!)

## Data Rendering

Data is rendered depending on the LLA type and the frame type.

### Async Serial

**frame.data["data"]** bytes are rendered as ASCII if their value is `<= 127`
and `>= 32`. For other values Python's `hex()` function is used and a space is
appended.

**frame.data["address"]** if present and True renders frame.data as a byte using
`hex()` and appends a space and preceeded by @.

**frame.data["error"]** is ignored.

### I2C

#### Frame Type: "address"

**frame.address["address"]** is rendered as a hex value with a space appended
and preceded by @.

Other **frame.address** fields are not currently decoded.

**frame.data["data"]** is rendered as a hex value with a space is appended.

Other **frame.data** fields are not currently decoded.

**frame.start** is ignored.

**frame.stop** triggers a match attempt. This allows a trailing `.*` to match
all of the transaction following an address match.
